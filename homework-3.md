# HOMEWORK 3
  
  For your third homework you are responsible for making "search functionality" for our
  to do list application. On the top or bottom of the todo-list we need an input field to search our
  specific todo items.
  
  ## Requirements: 
  
  - Style of this application will "NOT" be considered for homework-2. (you can use default styles)
  
  - When any input is searched we need to list our todo items including this search text.
  
  - We need to find any to do item which "includes" input text
   
    Examples are: 
  
   
    todoItems = ["aegean sea", "react realm", "make search", "work hard"]
    Example 1) search-text = "ea"   result: ["aegean sea", "react realm", "make search"]
    Example 2) search-text = "ar"   result: ["make search", "work hard"]
    Example 3) search-text = "work"   result: ["work hard"]
    Example 4) search-text = "made"   result: [""]

  
  
  ## Hints: 
  
    -You can use ".includes()" method for this operation.You can find an excellent description of the method here:
    https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/includes
    -Just look the comments that i've added to our code-base and when you follow the hints your homework will be done :)
    -Do not afraid of changing data-structures we already have. You "must" choose best structure for your app needs.
    -Be sure any cheating will be detected and will not be tolarated...
