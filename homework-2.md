# HOMEWORK 2
  
  For your second homework you are responsible for making "delete functionality" for our
  to do list application. Each todo item in our list should have delete button and when it is clicked,
  it should be removed from the list.
  
  ## Requirements: 
  
  - Style of this application will "NOT" be considered for homework-2. (you can use default styles)
  
  - When delete button is pressed it should be removed from the list.
  
  - If there are two or more "same" tasks and delete button is pressed, "ONLY" selected one should be removed.
  
  
  ## Hints: 
  
    -Do not afraid of changing data-structures we already have. You "must" choose best structure for your app needs.
    -Also this homework is a good time to start styling your app.(I suggest you to add css styles in this homework)
    -Just look the comments that i've added to our code-base and when you follow the hints your homework will be done :)
    You don't need to copy paste any code from anywhere, just follow the hints and remember the flow that we make on 
    our lesson. 
    -Be sure any cheating will be detected and will not be tolarated...
